      "Implemented lazy loading techniques with React Router to achieve route-based code splitting, such as lazy() and Suspense, to split the application code into smaller chunks, thereby reducing the initial bundle size and improve page load times for different sections of the application by 10%.",
      "Leveraged useCallback hook to memoize event handlers, preventing unnecessary re-creations of functions on every render, thus optimized performance of web page by 5-7%.",

      "Wrapped big in size functional components with React.memo to memoize their rendered output based on their props, preventing unnecessary re-renders when the props remain unchanged, and improving overall rendering performance by 18%.",

      "Implemented virtualization techniques, such as react-window or react-virtualized, to render only the visible portion of large lists or grids, reducing memory consumption and improving rendering performance, especially in scenarios with large datasets.",

      "Utilized browser developer tools and performance profiling techniques to identify performance bottlenecks, such as unnecessary re-renders, inefficient component updates, or network latency issues, and applied appropriate optimization strategies to address them effectively.",
